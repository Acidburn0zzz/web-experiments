	<h2>Empty or Disabled States</h2>
	<p>These are cases when a view is empty or the entire state of a view is changed, rather than show an empty window or the entire view in a disabled or insensitive fashion we display a message. Changing the view requires further action from a header bar item, such as re-enabling a setting to change overall state or importing items to fill the view, e.g. adding music.</p>
	<p>Empty states have a <code>128x128</code> pixel version of a relevant symbolic icon (with <code>.dim-label</code>), display a primary message as a <code>.type-title-1</code> and provide some body text explaining the state, as in the following examples.</p>
